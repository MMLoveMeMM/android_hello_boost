minimalistic example for creating an android app using the 'boost' library.
not the compile-only boost stuff, the actual boost library stuff. 

BASED ON

 1. hellojni example from android NDK 
 2. first.cpp example from boost_program_options source code
 3. http://www.codexperiments.com/android/2011/05/tips-tricks-building-boost-with-ndk-r5/
    android instructions by user "The Xperimenter"

TESTED ON

 ubuntu linux 10 and android-ndk-r7

HOW TO USE

 0 install android SDK, and android NDK, and get to the point where you can
   compile the hello_jni example and get it running on the emulator or a phone

 0.1 set your ANDROID_NDK. example:

  export ANDROID_NDK=~/android-ndk-r7

 0.2 download and unpack boost as described above. dont go any further yet. 

 0.3 if your version of bjam is too old (ubuntu 10.04 bjam is too old), 

     apt-get remove bjam
     cd $ANDROID_NDK/sources/boost/tools/build/v2
     run bootstrap.sh
     run b2 --prefix=/usr/local

 0.3 ok now, go and follow the instructions to get boost built, by editing
     the user-config.jam file as described, and running bjam. look under
     $ANDROID_NDK/sources/boost/android/lib to see if any libs built
    
 0.4 create sources/boost/Android.mk as described

 1.0 get this repository

  cd $ANDROID_NDK/samples
  git clone git://github.com/donbright/android_hello_boost.git
  cd android_hello_boost
 
 2.0 build it

  ../../ndk-build

 result should be like this:

Gdbserver      : [arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3] libs/armeabi/gdbserver
Gdbsetup       : libs/armeabi/gdb.setup
Compile++ thumb  : hello-boost <= hello-boost.cpp
Compile++ thumb  : hello-boost <= first.cpp
Prebuilt       : libboost_thread.a <= <NDK>/sources/boost/android/lib/
Prebuilt       : libboost_program_options.a <= <NDK>/sources/boost/android/lib/
Prebuilt       : libgnustl_static.a <= <NDK>/sources/cxx-stl/gnu-libstdc++/libs/armeabi/
SharedLibrary  : libhello-boost.so
Install        : libhello-boost.so => libs/armeabi/libhello-boost.so
$

 3.0 install it to the emulator or phone
 
   ant debug install

 4.0 test it

   look at your emulator/phone. there should be a new app called 'hello boost'
   click it. it should open a window with a grey title bar saying 'hello boost'. 
   then it should print 'hello boost' onto the black section of the screen.

HOW THIS WAS MADE

 I started out with the hellojni example.
 I ran 'android project -p . -whatever' like the instructions say to generate the manifest, etc. 
 I made my own Android.mk based on the instructions from The Xperimenter
